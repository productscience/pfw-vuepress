### How to use this book

This guide is structured in three main sections. While the first two sections are designed to provide context and introduce a way to think about the environmental impact of digital products, the third is designed as a 'recipe book'

- Section one explains why you might care about this at all, giving some background about the green house effect, the role technology plays, and the scale of the changes need to stay within safe levels of climate change.

- Section two presents a mental model to help think about the issue, and see how digital products you use or make might create an environmental impact. It also presents a way to measure this.

- Section three consists of guides showing how to make meaningful steps to reduce this impact, based on the tools you may use, and the stack of technologies used to build your digital product or service, with estimates of the impact of each step.
